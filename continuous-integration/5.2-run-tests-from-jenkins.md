1. Go to Build section. Select Execute Windows batch command

![](/assets/CreateProject_2.png)

**Enter the following commands into it**

```
cd C:\Program Files\SmartBear\ReadyAPI-1.9.0\bin
testrunner.bat -FPDF -f "C:\Test\Reports" -R"ProjectReport" C:\Test\<projectName>.xml
```

If you want to rename the report from Project report to a desired name it is not possible directly in soapui ng pro. However, we can create an additional build step in jenkins to rename using the following command wherein the %ReportName% depicts the String parameter used in Jenkins project.

```
cd C:\Test\Reports
rename "ProjectReport.pdf" "%ReportName%.pdf"

```

Save the project.
