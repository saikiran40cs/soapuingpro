# ReadyAPI - Resolve License errors in Jenkins {#ant-basics}

---

While running tests in jenkins if you have encountered invalid license as in below case

```
14:56:18,621 INFO  [DefaultSoapUICore] All plugins loaded
No valid SoapUIPro license exists.
Do you want to install a license? [y/N]: 14:56:18,731 ERROR [SoapUIProTestCaseRunner] java.util.NoSuchElementException
14:56:18,731 ERROR [SoapUI] An error occurred [java.util.NoSuchElementException], see error log for details
java.util.NoSuchElementException
```

When you run the testrunner from Jenkins, you may encounter a “license not found” error.

A common cause of this is that you are not running Jenkins with the same user account you activated the SoapUI NG license with.

Whether you are running Jenkins independently as a service or on your application server, you need to ensure it is running with the same user account you activated the SoapUI NG license with. This topic describes how to fix this.

For Windows Users

* Verify that you have a valid license activated. If you do not have a valid license, activate a SoapUI NG license.
* Open the **Control Panel**.
* Select **System and Security **and then **Administrative Tools**.
* Run the **Services **utility.
* Search for the `Jenkins`service.
* Right-click the service and select **Properties**.
* In the **Log On **tab, select **This account **and enter the user account name and password you activated the SoapUI NG license with.

* Restart the service to apply changes.

When Jenkins is run under a proper user,`testrunner`will find a license and work without the error:
