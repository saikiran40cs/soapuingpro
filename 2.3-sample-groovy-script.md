### Sample Groovy script {#creation-of-project}

---

To run and execute advanced tests using SoapUI/ReadyAPI a basic knowledge of Groovy programming language is required.

[Apache](http://www.apache.org/)[Groovy ](http://www.groovy-lang.org/single-page-documentation.html)is a  **powerful**,**optionally typed **and **dynamic  **language, with **static-typing and static compilation **capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise,**familiar and easy to learn syntax**. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities,**Domain-Specific Language **authoring, run time and compile-time **meta-programming **and **functional **programming.



Below is the sample script to test whether arithmetic operators works or not.

```
// Addition Operator
int x1 = 100 + 200
log.info (“Addition Result :” + x1);

// Concatenation of Two Strings using PLUS ( + ) operator
String city =”Timothy E.” + ” Shepherd”;
log.info(“String Concatenation:” + city);

// Subtraction Operator
int x2 = 200 – 100
log.info (“Subtraction :” + x2);

// Multiplication Operator
int x3 = 10 * 200
log.info (“Multiplication :” + x3);

// Division Operator
int x4 = 200 / 10
log.info (“Division :” + x4);

// Modulus Operator
int x5 = 10 % 3
log.info (“Reminder or Modulus:” + x5);
```

Execute using the Groovy script step in the ReadyAPI/ SoapUI as a test step.
