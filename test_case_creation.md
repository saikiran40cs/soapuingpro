To automate your tests, for example to send multiple requests at once or create [data-driven tests](http://readyapi.smartbear.com/soapui/data_driven/start), you need to create a SoapUI NG test:

* Right-click the REST request and select **Add to TestCase**.

* Specify the name of the TestSuite and TestCase that will contain the request. SoapUI NG will create a TestSuite and TestCase for the request.
* Specify the name of the request and leave the rest of the options the same. Click **OK**
